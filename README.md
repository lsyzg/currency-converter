What is it?:
A website utilizing flask that allows you to input amounts of currencies and convert it into a seperate one. It also allows you to visualise the changes in the exchange rate over a period of 5 years.
Why:
this is a project that I created to further my knowledge of apis, web design, flask, and other concepts.
